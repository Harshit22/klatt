Installation Instructions
-------------------------

I have not tried to compile this code on anything but the Sun Sparc
architecture. I would appreciate any comments regarding problems or
successes with compilation on other types of machine.

On a unix machine, type 'make' to compile a copy of klatt in the
current directory. 'make install' will copy the relevant files into
the required installation binary and manual page directories. These
directories are specified at the top of the makefile and can be edited
according to local site requirements.

Use 'make clean' to remove all files created during compilation and
installation. This will leave you with the original distribution.

The code uses the 'proto' macro in an attempt at portability between
ANSI and K&R style C compilers. It has successfully been compiled
using 'cc' and 'gcc' on the Sun Sparc architecture.
